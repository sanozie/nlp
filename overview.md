# Overview
NLP is the process of having machines process and understand natural languages for a variety of purposes, including comprehension, generation, and copying. 

AI and NLP are related in purpose, as well as in implementation techniques. Both strive to automate the comprehension of data, whereas NLP focuses on natural languages. Both can use machine learning principles to enhance this task.

Natural language understanding is the process of deriving meaning through a combination of context, definitions, and sentiments from language. Natural language generation is the process of representing new ideas in language with automation.

## Rules-Based NLP
As the original NLP approach, Rules-based NLP relies on known grammatical structures and definitions of words to generate meaning of a sentence.
However, natural languages are not as clear-cut as the rules make them out to be. Changing meanings & contexts over the years, ambiguity, and general complexity of human languages made creating a viable NLP product with rules not viable.
An example of this approach is Eliza, a 1960's bot that attempted to ask as a therapist with a human 

## Statistical and Probabilistic NLP
By using classic machine learning approaches, NLP capabilities expanded past some challenges of ambiguity.
With a decently sized dataset, these models are seen as the current standard of many types of NLP problems.
An example of this are rudimentary translation systems still in use today.

## Deep Learning NLP
As the size of properly processed language data exponentially grew alongside computing power through the years, deep learning NLP approaches became more and more viable.
This is the thought process behind popular remixes of neural networks, including LSTMs.
Google recently announced that they are transitioning their search to BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which uses neural networks as well.

## Personal Interests
NLP is such an interesting tool to me because I believe it can open up doors for new types of products that don't exist yet.
Personally, I'd love to build an app that could build models on questions asked in classes at colleges all over the country, with teacher's responses as well.
Then I'd suggest answers to students with their teacher's approval, so that students don't have to wait for emails back from their instructors.
