# HW1
This program takes in a CSV with people's metadata, formats and validates the info, then stores it,.

Here is an example on how to run the file
```shell
python main.py ./data/data.csv
```
The first argument is the name of the file, while the second is the path to the data.

I believe that Python's text-processing strength is it's simplicity. Splitting strings, reading CSV's, and formatting data is much easier in Python than in any other programming language that I've used so far.

Personally, I was glad to review RegEx's uses in this homework. It's a great refresher!
